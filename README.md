# 🌐 Web Scraping Portfolio

This repo has a few web scraping projects I built using Python.  
I used **Requests**, **BeautifulSoup**, and **APIs** to collect and save data into CSV/JSON files.  

## 📂 Projects

### 🚗 CarWale New Cars Scraper
- Scrapes car names, prices, and links from the CarWale new cars page.  
- Also collects car brand names and their pages.  
- Output saved in CSV files.

### 🧑‍💼 Jobs Scraper
- Scrapes job postings (title, company, location, and link) from a fake job board.  
- Handles multiple pages and saves the data in both CSV and JSON.  

### 🌍 Google Shopping Scraper (API)
- Uses SerpApi to fetch product data from Google Shopping.  
- Extracts product name, price, source, and direct link.  
- Includes both a simple version and a paginated version.

## Notes
- These projects are for practice and portfolio only.  
- API keys are not shared in the code (you gotta use your own).
